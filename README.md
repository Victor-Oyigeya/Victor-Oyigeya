[Brief Introduction]

I am cybersecurity ethusiast who just completed the Google Cybersecurity program, with strong foundational knowledge on different security policies and frameworks, how to use playbooks to respond to incidents, and a firm understanding of the processes involved in creating tickets and escalalting the security incident. Through the course activities on the Google Cybersecurity program, I have been able to create a Vulnerability Assessment report using the NIST SP 800-30 to guide the risk analysis, applied the NIST CSF framework to an incident report analysis, updated file permissions in Linux and also experimented with programming languages, such as SQL and Python.
